Realtime Elevator
==============

This is a project in course TTK4145 where the main goal is to build a system where multiple elevators have to communicate with each other over a network and cooperate in order to serve elevator orders. The built system should serve the different orders more effectively compared to a system having independent elevators without any communication. In addition to this, the elevators should function properly even with network problems. More on the system specification can be found here: https://github.com/TTK4145/Project.

- The inspiration for the state machine module came from Kjetil Kjeka's realtime elevator library (https://github.com/kjetilkjeka/Real-time-elevator).
- The network module was based on Tharald Stray's and Johan Korsnes's realtime elevator code (https://github.com/tharaldyo/realtime-elevator). 
- The elevator_interface module was provided as well (https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-erlang/blob/master/src/elevator_interface.erl).
